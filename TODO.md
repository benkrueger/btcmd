# Implementation Plan for btcmd

## Project Goals
`btcmd` is a utility designed for efficiently managing torrent files. It includes functionalities such as sorting, searching, pruning, and operating as a daemon.

## Features

### 1. Sorting Torrent Files
- **Objective**: Organize torrent files based on specific criteria such as name, size, date added, or other metadata.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Define the criteria for sorting (e.g., name, size, date).
  2. Develop a sorting algorithm that can handle large collections of torrent files efficiently.
  3. Allow user customization for sorting parameters via command-line options or configuration files.

### 2. Searching Torrent Files
- **Objective**: Implement a search functionality similar to `grep` to locate torrent files based on keywords or patterns.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Utilize a pattern matching library or custom implementation to search file names and metadata.
  2. Support regular expressions for advanced searching capabilities.
  3. Optimize for speed and efficiency, especially with large datasets.

### 3. Running as a Daemon
- **Objective**: Enable `btcmd` to run continuously in the background, periodically executing its tasks.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Implement background process management using system-specific conventions (e.g., `nohup`, systemd services).
  2. Ensure low memory and CPU resource usage for continuous operation.
  3. Implement logging mechanisms to track activities and issues while running.

### 4. Pruning/Detecting Dead Torrents
- **Objective**: Identify and remove or flag torrents that are no longer active or have zero seeders/peers.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Interface with torrent client APIs to fetch current activity status.
  2. Develop a heuristic or use existing metrics to evaluate torrent activity.
  3. Implement automated pruning based on user-defined criteria (e.g., inactive for X days).

## Development Milestones
1. **Initial Setup**: Create a codebase structure and set up version control.
2. **Basic Sorting and Searching**: Implement and test sorting and searching functionalities.
3. **Daemon Capability**: Integrate background processing and test continuous execution.
4. **Pruning Functionality**: Implement detection and pruning of dead torrents.
5. **Testing and Documentation**: Conduct thorough testing and update documentation.

## Testing and Deployment
- Incorporate unit and integration tests for each feature.
- Use continuous integration (CI) to automate testing and deployment.
- Prepare a detailed user guide within the repository to assist users.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with popular torrent clients for enhanced management.
- User interface (CLI/GUI) improvements for ease of use.
- Extended analytics and reporting features for torrent activities.

This plan outlines the key steps necessary to achieve the stated goals for the `btcmd` project. Each feature should be developed with scalability and performance in mind to ensure efficient handling of torrent files.
