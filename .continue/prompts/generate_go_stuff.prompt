description: Do stuff to setup and maintain the go programmin environment.

This repo is a go project. Go through the entire project and figure out what dependencies need to be imported, what the go mod file must be
and what command need to be run in order to build, test and debut this project. The project looks like:
@repo-map
@tree
@os
You can run commands or search the web if necessary. Output the go mod and go package files for this codebase, and output the commands needed to install all dependencies.
Do not output CI/CD files, we will do that later.
